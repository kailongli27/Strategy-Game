# Strategy-Game

A simplified version of a Civilization-inspired strategy game that utilizes the concepts of object-oriented programming.

The classes [Settler](Settler.java), [Worker](Worker.java), and [MilitaryUnit](MilitaryUnit.java) are all subclasses of the abstract class [Unit](Unit.java).

The classes [Warrior](Warrior.java) and [Archer](Archer.java) extend the abstract class [MilitaryUnit](MilitaryUnit.java).

The class [ListOfUnits](ListOfUnits.java) is an implementation of an arraylist of Units.

the class [Tile](Tile.java) represents a square on the board on which the game will be played.
